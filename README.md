# 🧠 NeuroSymbolic Mental Health AI

### Objective  
This repository explores the integration of **Neuro-Symbolic Artificial Intelligence (AI)** for explainable mental health monitoring and emotional climate assessment. The goal is to design interpretable systems capable of detecting early signs of psychological distress, reassurance patterns in hallucination-related contexts, and institutional well-being trends.  
### Background  
This work sits at the intersection of AI/ML Mental Health and cognitive understanding, combining deep learning and symbolic reasoning to achieve human-centered, transparent decision-making. It is inspired by current research on explainable NLP, affective computing, and neuro-symbolic reasoning.

### Planned Components  
- Emotion and sentiment detection using NLP  
- Symbolic reasoning for interpretability  
- Visualization of emotional trends over time  
- Early warning system for stress or distress signals  
- Ethical design for mental health AI systems  

### Tech Stack  
Python • Transformers (Hugging Face) • PyTorch • scikit-learn • Neuro-Symbolic Reasoning Libraries  

### Status  
Initial conceptual stage — prototype and notebook development in progress.
